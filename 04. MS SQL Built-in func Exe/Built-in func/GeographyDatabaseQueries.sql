-- Problem 12.	Countries Holding ‘A’ 3 or More Times
-- Find all countries that holds the letter 'A' in their name at least 3 times (case insensitively), sorted by ISO code. Display the country name and ISO code. 
SELECT [CountryName], [IsoCode] FROM Countries
	WHERE LEN([CountryName]) - LEN(REPLACE([CountryName], 'A', '')) >= 3 
		ORDER BY [IsoCode] ASC

-- Problem 13.	 Mix of Peak and River Names
-- Combine all peak names with all river names, so that the last letter of each peak name is the same as the first letter of its corresponding river name.
-- Display the peak names, river names, and the obtained mix (mix should be in lowercase). Sort the results by the obtained mix.
SELECT p.[PeakName], r.[RiverName], LOWER(CONCAT(p.PeakName, SUBSTRING(	r.RiverName,2,LEN(r.RiverName) -1))) AS [Mix]
	FROM Peaks AS p, Rivers AS r
	WHERE RIGHT(p.PeakName, 1) = LEFT(r.RiverName, 1)
		ORDER BY MIX ASC
